A demo application for calculating required landmass removal for engineering projects with a local SQLite database for data storage and a possibility to output data to PDF format and printing functionality.

The software consists of multiple screens with modern, easy-to-use UI. The user can add new projects to which to add dimensions for subunits. The subunits are then calculated to show the total or individual landmass removal required for the subunit or entire project. Your previous data can be saved and retrieved from a clear UI. 
The PDF page converts the data into a PDF-friendly format that can then be printed out or stored for later use. 

The software was built with Flutter/Dart and uses the Drift Flutter library (utilizing SQLite) for database functionality. 

Potential additional features:
- Excavation and backfill cost calculation
- CO2 footprint and emission report and calculation
- Nearest landfill location and cost data analysis
- Provide excavation data for machinery
