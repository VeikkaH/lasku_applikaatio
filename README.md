# Earthmoving calculator software

A demo application for calculating required landmass removal for engineering projects with a local database for storing data and PDF/printing functionality.
The software has navigation through multiple screens with easy-to-use UI. The user can add new projects to which to add subunits with dimensions that are calculated to show the total or individual landmass removal required for the subunit or entire project. 
The PDF page converts the data into a PDF-friendly format that can then be printed out or stored for later use. 
Software was built with Flutter/Dart and uses the Drift Flutter library (utilizing SQLite) for database functionality.
